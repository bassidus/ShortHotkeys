**Tired of Blizzard's default keybind text getting cut off on action bars?**

This addon fixes that by shortening the default keybind text so it fits properly without being truncated.

You can also fully customize the keybind text to your liking through the addon options. Just type `/shk` in chat to access them quickly.

**Want to help with translations?**
